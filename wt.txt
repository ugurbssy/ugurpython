The phenomenon that some consumers pay a higher interest rate when they borrow than the interest rate they receive when they lend is best described as an example of
-irrational behaviour.
+a credit market imperfection.
-a vast banking conspiracy.
-the burden of public debt.
-predatory lending practices.
If consumers face higher interest rates when their savings is positive than when their savings is negative,
-Ricardian equivalence holds.
-there is no asymmetric information.
+the government may be able to increase welfare by cutting taxes.
-the size of the government should be reduced.
-the economy can do without collateral.
Asymmetric information means
+some market participants have more information than others.
-some news are more important than others.
-some market participants interpret news differently.
-the impact of news on economic outcomes depends on the context.
-consumers do not understand completely their own preferences.
Asymmetric information in the credit market means that
+the bank cannot distinguish bad borrowers from good borrowers.
-the bank cannot prevent consumers from defaulting on their loans.
-the default rate on loans is excessively high.
-borrowers can borrow from financial institutions other than banks.
-consumers can only borrow from banks.
If there are fewer bad borrowers in the population when there is asymmetric information
+the interest rate spread declines.
-the interest rate spread increases.
-the value of collateral increases.
-banks make positive profits.
-good borrowers are worse off.
An interest rate spread is
-the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates.
-the difference between nominal and real interest rates.
+the difference between lending and borrowing interest rates.
-the difference between public and commercial interest rates.
-the difference between the interest rates on different stocks.
A default premium is the interest rate premium
-under normal market circumstances.
-when there are no market fluctuations.
+covering the default risk.
-for government debt.
-a borrower receives after defaulting.
If the value of collateral falls for a consumer,
-current consumption must fall.
-current consumption must rise.
-future consumption must fall.
+current consumption falls only if the collateral constraint binds.
-current consumption falls only if the collateral constraint does not bind.
A collateral constraint captures the idea that
-there is asymmetric information in credit markets.
-assets may be of no use.
+consumers need incentives not to abscond on their debts.
-Ricardian equivalence always holds.
-the budget constraint is irrelevant.
Limited commitment means
+one cannot credibly promise something.
-one saves only part of what is optimal.
-only some households are allowed to save.
-there is rationing on the credit market.
-only governments can borrow.
Collateralizable wealth is
-wealth in non-tangible assets.
+any asset that can be used to obtain a loan.
-wealth that increases and income increases.
-wealth based on mortgage lending.
-any increase in wealth from lending.
In a simple model of credit imperfections, when consumers borrow and lend at different interest rates, the budget line is kinked because
-the consumer cannot consumer more than disposable income in any period.
-taxes exceed income.
-the consumer lends at a higher rate than they borrow.
+the consumer lends at a lower rate than they borrow.
-income exceeds taxes.
When consumers lend at a lower rate than they borrow, a decrease in current taxes implies
+current consumption increases by the amount of the tax cut.
-current consumption remains unchanged.
-both current and future consumption increase.
-current savings increases by the amount of the tax cut.
-current consumption decreases and future consumption increases.
When there are credit-market imperfections, an increase in government debt may be advantageous because it
-discourages credit-constrained consumers from borrowing too much.
+allows credit-constrained consumers to borrow more.
-eliminates the problems that cause credit-market imperfections.
-encourages more private saving.
In the two-period model, a bank
-creates money.
-keeps money safely.
-multiplies reserves.
+borrows and lends.
-is generally unnecessary.
In the two-period model, the nature of the asymmetric information is that
-only the bank knows who the bad borrowers are.
+only borrowers know whether they are bad or not.
-only borrowers know the value of their collateral.
-only banks can value the collateral.
-only consumers know their income when it is received.
The default premium increases when there is a(n)
+decrease in the fraction of good borrowers.
-increase in the fraction of good borrowers.
-increase in the bank profits.
-decrease in risk.
-increase in liquidity.
If the proportion of bad borrowers increases,
-the lending interest rate increases.
-the lending interest rate decreases.
+the borrowing interest rate increases.
-the borrowing interest rate decreases.
-the borrowing and lending interest rates are equal.
The 1990-1992 recession was unlikely to be associated with financial factors since
+there was little change in interest rates.
-consumption did not drop.
-interest spreads increased right from the start.
-interest rates for lending and borrowing went up.
-profits in the banking sector increased.
If consumers use their house as collateral for lending and the value of housing in general falls, then
-lending is unchanged and future consumption increases.
-borrowing increases further to maintain current consumption.
+lending and aggregate consumption decrease.
-lenders prefer to become borrowers.
-lending and aggregate consumption increase.
If the collateral constraint does not bind, then in response to a decrease in the price, p, of the asset
-the consumer increases both current and future consumption.
-the consumer decreases current consumption and future consumption is unchanged.
-the consumer leaves current consumption unchanged and increases future consumption.
-the consumer increases current consumption and decreases future consumption.
+the consumer decreases both current and future consumption.
For a consumer not bound by the collateral constraint, a reduction in the price of the collateral leads to
-nothing.
-an increase in current consumption and a decrease in future consumption.
-a decrease in current consumption and no change in future consumption.
+a decrease in current and future consumption.
-no change in current consumption and a decrease in future consumption.
For a consumer bound by the collateral constraint, a reduction in the price of the collateral leads to
-nothing.
-an increase in current consumption and a decrease in future consumption.
+a decrease in current consumption and no change in future consumption.
-a decrease in current and future consumption.
-an increase in current and future consumption.
In a pay-as-you-go system,
+the young transfer resources to the old.
-there is no opportunity for saving.
-young households pay for their retirement directly.
-the government pays for retirement.
-the old receive income from assets purchased when they were young.
In a fully-funded social security program
-the young pay for the benefits of the old.
+the young are forced to save for their own retirement.
-the young have to buy bonds for the old.
-the young are forced to save for the retirement of the old.
Why do consumers benefit from pay-as-you-go social security?
-It keeps inflation in check as money is redistributed.
-It is a better way than taxes to finance the government.
-It forces people to save more than they would otherwise.
+With sufficiently high population growth, many young contribute to the benefits of the old.
-With sufficiently low population growth, the young can perpetually contribute more.
In a pay-as-you-go social security system, everyone can be made better off only if
+the population growth rate exceeds the real interest rate.
-the real interest rate remains higher than the population growth rate.
-the number of old households exceeds the number of young households.
-the interest rate for borrowers is sufficiently below that of lenders.
-it is preceded by a fully funded system.
Consumer choice theory predicts that, with identical consumers, pay-as-you-go social security
-always makes all generations worse off.
-makes some generations better off, and cannot make any generation worse off.
-may make some generations worse off and cannot make any generation better off.
+may be Pareto improving.
-always makes all generations worse off compared to a fully-funded system.
Consumer choice theory predicts that, with identical consumers, fully-funded social security
-always makes all generations worse off.
-makes some generations better off, and cannot make any generation worse off.
+may make some generations worse off and cannot make any generation better off.
-may be Pareto improving.
-can potentially reduce welfare.
The commitment problem that may make a forced savings social security program beneficial is best described by
-too much saving by households because the government cannot commit to providing zero retirement assistance.
-borrowers are unable to commit to a high real interest rate.
-young households cannot commit to participating when they are old.
-the government cannot commit to providing benefits when old.
+under saving by households because the government cannot commit to providing zero retirement assistance.
Social security is most likely to present political problems when
+moving from pay-as-you-go to fully-funded and when population growth is low.
-moving from pay-as-you-go to fully-funded and when population growth is high.
-moving from fully-funded to pay-as-you-go and when population growth is low.
-moving from fully-funded to pay-as-you-go and when population growth is high.
-moving from pay-as-you-go to fully-funded and when the government funds benefits for the current old generation.
Moral hazard represents a problem for fully-funded social security because
-the government is likely to never pay out promised benefits.
-households invest in assets that are too safe.
-population growth remains below the real interest rate.
+households would invest retirement savings in risky assets.
-population growth exceeds the real interest rate.
Pay-as-you-go social security works in situations where
-Ricardian equivalence holds.
+the population growth rate exceeds the real interest rate.
-the population growth rate is less than the real interest rate.
-the government cannot commit.
-fully funded social security is illegal.
A fully funded social security program
-solves the Ricardian equivalence problem.
-works when the population growth rate exceeds the real interest rate.
-redistributes income between generations.
+is forced savings, but can work if the government cannot commit to bailing out destitute retirees.
-is always better than a pay-as-you-go system.
